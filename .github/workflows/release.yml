          # Use the Release Name/Title as the text, but do not include a URL link.
          # The variable ${{ github.event.release.name }} holds the release title you set.
          title: "Guidelines got updated."
          # By leaving the URL parameter out (or setting it to empty), 
          # you prevent the title text from becoming a hyperlink.
          # url: "" # You can remove this line, as omitting it removes the link.
          
          # 2. Timestamp:
          # This action typically includes the publish date/time by default.
          # We don't need to add a specific parameter, but if you want to ensure the 
          # current time is sent, you can use the built-in variable.
